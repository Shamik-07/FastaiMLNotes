# Introduction
It wouldn't be far off to say that this is the best ML course. There are two sides of learning ML: 1. Theory 2. Practical, while the former is much required it's oft better to get your hands dirty and start with the latter and learn the former as required. While there are many other resources and notes for this course(mentioned below), this is what i learnt from the course.
